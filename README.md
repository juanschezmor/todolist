# ToDoList App with React

This is a simple ToDoList application developed with React. You can use this application to keep track of your daily tasks and maintain a record of what you need to do.

## Features

- Add new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Remove completed tasks.
- View the creation date of each task.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the application on your local environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-react.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd todo-list-react
    ```
    
3. Install the dependencies using npm:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Start the application:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    

The application will open in your default web browser. You can now start adding and managing your tasks.

## How It Works

The application uses React components to manage tasks. Each task has a title, description, and creation date. You can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and remove completed tasks. The application uses `randomcolor` to generate random colors for each task.
